## emailbot.py ##
The actual product and script. Not the best organized, nor the best commented, but does what it is meant to do. Looks for the presence of config.txt in its own directory, and it must be there!

## config.txt ##
This is where you will need to configure your email settings, as well as point to the files for contacts and the message if you do not want to choose them at runtime.

## contacts.txt ##
File contacts are read from

## message.txt ##
Email is created from a straight text file.
